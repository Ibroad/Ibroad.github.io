Emmm...First of All, CELEBRATE my success in building this blog after 5-days highly concentrated but still satisfied work.  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. It's not an easy work for a totally new hand like me ðŸ¤¯ but when I saw it growing up bit by bit just like my baby, excitment defeated all the problems.  
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Cheers ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ.

The idea about building my own blog occured to me in this summer. At the very beginning, I just want to find a place to `track my learning`, `deepen understanding` as well as `practice my ability of expression in English`. **No self-built server needed, less knowledge of html required, free to customize**, 3 key characters of GitHub Pages + Jekyll caught me. And then... as you see, it works! I am pleased to tell you the first reason why I Blog below.  
  
+ #### Writing helps me to clarify my thoughts 

The most important reason why I decided to pick up blog is its effective funtion of **clarifying**, both for knowledge like programming 
, embeded system and for indistinct thoughts maybe making me anxious but I haven't figured out. When I put myself into writing a post, it forces me to ruminate what I have thought before. For knowledge, it provides a way to teach myself again like what's in Feynman learning method. And for thoughts, writing a post makes it more organized and get me rid of it after writing.  

In this blog, most of the posts are about learning of 3 categories in the upper right-hand coner (maybe added). I will also write some essaies. If the access speed problem is solved, I really want to add galleryies. Full of expectationðŸ˜œ.  
  
Emmm... at the very beginning, I haven't expected to make friends through blog. However, I am really looking forward to have several bosom friends. So if you like my blog or interested about what I'd written or have your own opinion. Welcome to comment in the `issue ` of `Ibroad.github.io` reposity (not willing to add comment function within blog).
